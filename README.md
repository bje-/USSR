USSR is a LibreOffice Calc workbook to configure basic grid-connected
solar PV systems. It matches modules to inverters, calculates DC
isolator ratings, voltage drops and estimates system yields. New
inverters, modules and locations can be added to the worksheet.

USSR is licensed under the GPLv3 free software license.

## Instructions

1. Work through each yellow worksheet from left to right.
2. Enter data into yellow cells.

You may need to enter module or inverter data into the blue
